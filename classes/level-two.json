	"classDescription": "	This powerful, often sweat drenching practice cultivates cleansing heat in the body 
	and builds strength, stamina and focus. Flow 2 begins standing and moves into a 
	50-minute dynamic standing flow, incorporating a wide-range of arm-balances and “sense of adventure poses.” The pace is brisk, yet intelligent, and the intensity and heat come more from the pace than from the holds or complexity. From here, we move to the mat for deeper, longer forward, back and hip-opening postures, 5-minutes of dynamic core work and deliver you into a scrumptious savasana and final meditation. Flow 2 is a vibrant/alive journey that leaves you refreshed, inspired and alive.",
